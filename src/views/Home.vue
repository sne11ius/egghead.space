              egghead.space is a place to share project ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              I used to have various lists with notes for projects I don't have the time to actually
              work on. &ndash; .txt files, gists, paper notes flying around, being lost, forgotten
              and not always found again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then one day came another idea: why not build central
              place to note project ideas? And while we're on it: why not share these ideas and
              maybe get some comments and suggestions?
            </p>
            <p>
              So this is that place: share, discuss and vote project ideas. Since "project idea" is
              a rather long term, we simply call them "sketches".
